# CAMSHIFT TOOL

This was a tool that I wrote years ago to help design and debug a CSoC (CAMShift on Chip). It should never have been written in MATLAB in the first place, but it started off as a series of MATLAB scripts and then grew into this mess from there.

I doubt this is of any use to anyone in the world, including me, but here it is for posterity.

# Requirements
- MATLAB. I don't even remember now which version I used, but it was a slightly old version at the time, probably 2011b or something.
- Don't need any toolboxes, everything is in here.
