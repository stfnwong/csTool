FIX READ FILE BUTTON IN csToolSaveBuf GUI

GET RID OF renderMode flag
I now think it makes more sense for the flag that indicates how to return
the data to be a property of the csFrame object in the buffer. When a new
random sequence is generated, we set a flag in the csFrame object.

hasImgData = false; 	%generated data
hasImgData = true; 		%read data from disk

if the hasImgData flag is true, we then check the frames img member, and if
it is empty, read the file from disk. Otherwise assume that the data in the
img member is the frame data and continue. 


CONSOLODATE FRAME BUFFER DATA LOADING METHODS

WEIGHT IMAGES
Need to track down a bug in weight image pipeline - need to follow execution in csSegmenter.

TRAJECTORY BROWSER
Add a method to manually specify ground truth trajectory
Also backprojection image generator should have a parameter to modify kQuant

FIX PARAM BROWSER!!!!!

FOR VERIFICATION ROUTINE
Should be able to read tracking vector from disk into trajectory browser to compare against original run. This would mean having the two frame buffers in the tool from initialisation and passing the both frame buffer in and out of the verification and trajectory browser GUIs

CHEAPEST FIX: Change the 'get current' button into 2 buttons, 'Get Current (reference)' and 'Get Current (test)', which fetch the current trajectory from the reference and test buffer respectively

READING VECTORS IN VERIFY GUI
Data seems to be placed in the wrong buffer (or both buffers) when data is read. This needs to be checked, as it has the effect of making all verification runs correct by default.

VERIFY
Moment data must be in a cell array to be set. For one set of moments we can just wrap the data in a cell array and be done with it. If the testbench is extracting moments from the accumulator, we might opts to put each iteration on a seperate line. Then the csTool parser will need some extra logic to read only to the next newline, and then examine if the subsequent character (after the newline) is an EOF. If not, continue reading and place the data into the next 'iteration' in the verification panel 

The reference parameter text boxes in the top right corner also need some work. The test parameter does not correctly display

Also TODO - does the verification GUI need a parameter browse function?

VECDISKREAD
Does this correctly read back data that doesnt have the modelsim address specifier at the begninng? The actual frame data comes back fine (it seems), but it appears on inspection that the parameter data is mangled in the GUI. When the source file is examined no problems are found (the data does match). EDIT: On closer inspection, its only the first digit of the first parameter that is bad.

GENERATE:
If param files are generated as well, make sure to include the file wparam_init
with the initial window parameters, which will be loaded at the start of the 
simulation

LOADFRAMEDATA
Do files check first

SEQUENCE GENERATOR:
Add options to generate multiple targets.

CSTOOLVERIFY
Need to properly rescale images that are read into buffer

There should be a way to get summary statistics over the entire tracking
run, for example the average number of iterations until convergence

=======================================================================
(FRAMEBUF INTERFACE BRANCH)
Re-write csFrameBuffer class to properly wrap each csFrame 

GENRANDIMG
Rather than call abs() on ellipse data, add offset and clip ranges to 
fit within image bounds.

VEC2BPIMG 
Add routine to force output to have 3 channels for hsv conversion


CSTOOLGUI
We actually dont need to perform the segmentation if we generated synthetic
backprojection data since it is by definition backprojected. Therefore the 
gui_procLoop() routine should be re-written to reflect this

Also need to do this for gui_showPreview()


CSSEGMENTER
Change segmentation internals to hide information about frame contents.

CSTRACKER
Change tracking internals to hide information about frame contents


========================================================================


VECMANAGER READ:
Problem in read method getting correct filename (SOLVED)
Need to strip out spaces in vecdata before we can assemble into frame

ARCHITECTURAL:

- Completely convert bpdata to be vector, rather than matrix (image grid)
- Write GUI class
- Flatten class heirachy. Once the GUI class is finished, there may be no more need
 for the csImProc class, as the GUI methods can call the csSegmenter and csTracker
 methods directly

- Write set of tracker unit tests
- Write set of segmenter unit tests

- Write new segmentation methods (PCA, HMM, etc etc)


FUNCTIONAL:

- Finish all vector reading/writing methods
- Write tests for these methods

The format of tests for the vecManager class should probably go something like this:

1) Get a series of frames
2) Segment
3) Track
(Results from the segmentation and tracking are stored in the framebuffer)
4) Generate a set of test vectors and write to disk
5) Read the vector back from disk
6) Run through the compare routine

The output from the disk read process will depend on what kind of vector is generated.
When an HSV vector is generated, we may either get back a column vector of hue values,
a column vector of backprojection values, or a row vector of backprojection values.

- Seems now like it would be a good idea to have some navigator/browser for the 
frame parameters, so that debugging (both of csTool itself and of the verilog tests)
can be made easier.

FUNCTIONAL (GUI):

So after some experimentation, it looks like the GUI doesn't quite work like I 
expected. At the time of writing, I create the persistent objects in the GUI before
the GUI is generated in another script (csToolStartGUI.m), and then place these in 
the opening function when the GUI is brought up. This sort of implies a kind of 
peicemeal initialisation process where we query every settable object in the GUI and 
use a setter method to change properties as required. A better idea might be something
like :

	- Have an autosave/autoload system that can save and recall the settings for all
	 the GUI controls. When the GUI starts, look for the autosave file and load the
	 values into the controls, and if the filen doesn't exist, use some defaults. 
	 Then pull the information out of each UI control, assemble an options structure
	 for each object, and initialise the objects, placing the result in the handles
	 structure for the GUI.

	- Go through the classes and create a more comprehensive collection of setter
	 methods so that when modifications are made in the GUI they can be updated in 
	 the objects as well.

The last point wasn't really that important in the previous command-line csTool as
it was used more as a batch processing utility (ie: read a set of files, perform 
processing, write out results).
It it worth noting here that the number of options that can be set in csTool is 
quite large, which makes laying them all out on a panel prohibitive space-wise.
I think that a sub-GUI which can be brought up for each of the objects is a better 
solution especially since the segmenter and tracker objects are really just 
organisationally convenient (ie: they store no persistent data), and so we can 
basically just destory and re-create them with a new constructor call if need be.
This also preempts the dreaded 'option-parser' scenario I once had in mind, where
there would be a seperate option parser, and the constructor would just call this
when a struct appeared in the input argument list (the original csTool actually had
this, but it seemed to defeat the point of having a class structure in the first 
place).

EXTRA:

- Put a full interpreter in GUI, so that every command can be accomplished by text
input




CLEANUP

- Make the class definitions follow this format:
		1) Constructor
		2) Getters
		3) Setters
		4) Processing methods (if any), e.g: tracking, segmentation...
		5) Static 

Currently the classdefs do loosely follow this, but some of the get and set elements 
are in odd places, and should be more consistent.

- Generally clean up help files, particularly the ones in classdefs, which should have
a complete listing of all the methods and properties, as well as a brief use case 
(even just calling syntax) for each method, and a 1 line description of each 
property

- Adjust the csToolSegOpts and csToolTrackOpts GUIs so that the actual object handle
isn't required. In other words, these sub-GUIs should just read in the current options
for updating the GUI elements, and return a modified options structure to the main
GUI. The main GUI will then instantiate the new object.
