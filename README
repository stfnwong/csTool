CAMSHIFT TOOL
Version 0.5b

New version of Camshift Testing Tool. (This version should be put into version control
and the previous version in module_test/iverilog/hbp/cst deprecated


NOTE: The oft-seen if(dims(3) > 3) construction there to deal with TIFF files 
sometimes having a 4th 'dimension' whn read. In a similar vein, caling size with 3
ouput arguments is done to deal with bugs in the size function (if only two output 
args required but 3 present, size will multiply the 2nd and 3rd output and present 
that as the 2nd output)
